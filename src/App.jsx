              I'm an analyst who prioritises human behaviour and experience when developing effective solutions. I believe creative, thoughtful design is just as important as well-defined process definitions- an almost obligate mutualism. Personally, I find great fulfilment in creating solutions that not only tackle the root issue and enhance processes, but are also a genuine joy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the moment, I'm a Technical Business Analyst at <a href="https://www.appsure.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>Appsure</b></a>, working in a close-knit team of seven. As a result, I've become a jack of all trades: leading business analysis, managing clients, digitising complex insurance pricing and product configuration, designing UX/UI for custom screens, driving marketing efforts, and constantly finding new ways to improve our software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I joined the technology industry, I worked in marketing, where I created campaigns and marketing artefacts, as well as in real estate, assisting with sales and property management. Through these experiences, I learned the importance of exposure and design, but also the necessity of having a solid product to back up any claims. This principle applies to SaaS and physical goods.

              Beyond work, I'm either cooking, leather crafting, gem hunting, or building some more. Maybe one day I'll re-ignite my early tween <a href="https://youtu.be/AgY_ffcXlOQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>VFX</b></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/CvfrsX2jdbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>stop-motion</b></a> dreams.

              My main hobby outside of work is cooking. It's a world that branches out endlessly, with recipes that vary across cultures, subcultures, continents, and even small regions. There are countless variations and so much to learn. I'm fascinated by how old and new techniques still coexist today, from the molcajete to bluetooth sous vide.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love curating dishes and menus to challenge myself, often running set menus and banquets for friends and family. These experiences demand a lot of theorising, practical planning, preparation, mise en place, and execution under pressure. Cooking keeps me on my toes and tests both my mind and body. But the end result is always rewarding: serving good food and seeing everyone's smiles.
